1. Do you have other tables like data.csv? If not, do you have other tables that have same contents in the data.csv file? 
- ML requires a brunch of data. If the we don't have a big data pool, we can't make sure the performance of final output is stable.
2. Can you give us an example of degradation **rate**? We can try to train a model using the quantity of bacterial populations in samples to predict water quality indicators, or conversely, predict bacterial populations based on water quality indicators. But how should we calculate the degradation rate? Could you provide a quantitative example of degradation rate or some qualitative examples, such as ‘good’ and ‘poor’?
